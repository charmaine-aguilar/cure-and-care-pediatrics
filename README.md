## How it's Made
__Tech used:__ HTML, CSS, JavaScript
<br><br>
I tried to keep the structure of the website as simple as I can with a mobile-first approach, but kept the responsiveness of the website in mind. I made sure to wrap components inside containers so that I could use flexbox and media queries appropriately. I also kept the primary actions of the visitors in mind, so I put appropriate cta buttons in the hero section to maintain concisiveness of the website.

## Optimizations
In the future, frameworks such as ReactJS would be a more appropriate approach to create the components of the website. I also think that using CSS methodologies such as BEM together with CSS preprocessors such as SASS would give us a more uniform structure and organization when styling the CSS sheet for future projects.

## Lesson Learned:
I learned that relying on using URLs as image sources can be more harmful for the site's loading time. In my case, I used a URL as a source for the image in the hero section. If you notice, when you load the website, it takes a little bit to load it all in. I learned that it would be better to have the images locally with different image dimensions for faster loading times.
